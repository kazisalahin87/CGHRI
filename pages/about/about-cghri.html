        <h1>About PSU Center for Global Health Research and Innovation</h1>
        <div class="content-section">
        <p>The world is now facing a deep crisis on fundamental principles of fairness and solidarity of a right-based approach to health and broader development gains which lead to a break-down in trust among stakeholders and further attribute to vulnerable communities. Building up coalitions of like-minded individuals, institutions and organisations who share a similar value system and a track record of real accomplishments over time is important to overcome these challenges. There are three shifts that are particularly of concern for the global health and welfare: increasing a damage to human societies and ever to the planet and the environment, growing inequality across countries, and finally rising complex governance.</p>
        <p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have given us a plan to fight these challenges. As we now approach a decade of action under SDGs, and we are in urgent to work together to ensure we leave no one left behind in all areas. Health is a particular important goal (SDG 3) to "ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages" which emphasizes the achievement of universal health coverage (UHC) and access to quality health care (no one must be left behind). Prince of Songkla University (PSU) where has diverse faculties, research and innovation experiences, must be ready to actively engage multi-disciplinary, multi-faculty, multi-sectoral groups coming together and interacting with global partners and institutions in further translating local experiences, evidence and innovations into and contribute to addressing changing global health problems, agenda and initiatives.</p>
        <p>The term ‚ÄúGlobal Health‚Äù in the name of the Center recognizes the globality of public health which considers the formalized and systematized process. The center will draw from many disciplinary possibilities available at PSU. At initial initiative, eight Faculties including the Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Nursing, Faculty of Destistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Faculty of Science, Faculty of Engineering, and Faculty of Agro-Insdustry have agreed upon to build this partnership under the Center addressing health related issues, generating evidence and creating innovative approaches.</p>
